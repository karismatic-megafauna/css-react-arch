# css-react-arch
a description of how CSS and React can work together, with articles and other resources.

### CSS Modules 
Very interested in Glen Maddern's [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)

### CSS in JS Libraries for React
https://github.com/FormidableLabs/radium/tree/master/docs/comparison is a comparison of 
css in js libraries for react. Not sure why CSS Modules is not included. Is this because
css modules are not IN js? Why are these different? Very interesting and all of them
are worth a look. Radium seems confusing and looks like it has a small learning curve,
which may not be a bad thing...
